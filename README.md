# -ReadMe-Generator
Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer packageLinks to an external site.. Review the Professional README GuideLinks to an external site. as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:
node index.js
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit 2.2.4: Screencastify Tutorial in Module 2 of the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
